* [Dynamic Tensor Rematerialization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09616.pdf) provides a technique for automatic checkpointing, which seems inherently compatible with the approach to reverse mode I want.

* [Fast AD](https://github.com/JamesYang007/FastAD/tree/master/include/fastad_bits/reverse) shows overloading comma might be useful.
